Next.js
Next.js is an elegant web app starter platform that combines an opinionated webpack configuration with React and more recently a
lightweight API layer.
Using next.js with Typescript provides an elegant way to develop webapps applications quickly while utilizing the
react ecosystem for prebuilt components. Due to how simple next.js makes development and deployment, it&rsquo;s become my go to development platform for
javascript webapps.
Graphql
Graphql was developed as a query language for large API surfaces as an alternative to
REST. Graphql allows web and mobile developers to define
what data they need from a backend declaratively with a single query while also providing valuable introspection capabilities
during development."><meta name=keywords content="experiments,"><meta name=author content="Suyog Sonwalkar"><meta property="og:url" content="https://suyogs.com/p/experiments/next-js-with-postgraphile/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Suyog Sonwalkar"><meta property="og:title" content="Next.js with Postgraphile"><meta property="og:description" content="Introducing next-postgraphile Motivation TODO: Finish up
