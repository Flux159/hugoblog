When I previously wrote about hosting a static site on github pages, I used Gatsby as the content generation system.
After a painful few days updating gatsby at the end of 2021, I decided to move off of Gatsby and over to Hugo.
The primary reason was because updating Gatsby through NPM caused a signficant number of breaking changes in the github action that published the site. This was unacceptable since the amount of time spent debugging the build process with upgrades could have been spent on more productive things."><meta name=keywords content="experiments,"><meta name=author content="Suyog Sonwalkar"><meta property="og:url" content="https://suyogs.com/p/new-hugo-blog/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Suyog Sonwalkar"><meta property="og:title" content="New Hugo Blog"><meta property="og:description" content="Updating blog from gatsby to hugo When I previously wrote about hosting a static site on github pages, I used Gatsby as the content generation system.
