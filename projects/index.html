Tigerbot was a project in college for CMU&rsquo;s Build18 event. It was a 2 wheeled robot made in 2011 that could be controlled via an iPhone. One PCB was custom developed, the low level microcontroller code was coded by Kevin Li, and the iPhone connected to the bot via a Beagleboard with USB Wifi.
Newsatlas.io
Newsatlas was a single page app that I used to learn AngularJS with - it is now defunct because Google removed the APIs that I was using to retrieve news data. The logic to map between a news article and the location was done client side based on how many times the articles description text contained a location. A filtered list of every city, country, and state was sent over to the client as a large dictionary to remove the need for a webserver."><meta name=keywords content><meta property="og:url" content="https://suyogs.com/projects/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Suyog's Blog"><meta property="og:title" content="Projects"><meta property="og:description" content="Tigerbot Tigerbot was a project in college for CMU’s Build18 event.
